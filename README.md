# Square grid tiling with shapes
## Problem
Consider an x n chessboard (n is given in input). You have *l* "L" pieces, *s* "square" pieces, and *r* "rectangle" pieces (see figure, the size of the rectangle is 3 x 1, the square is 2 x 2, the biggest side of the "L" are of size 2). *l*, *s*, *r* are given in input. The goal is to fill the chessboard with the pieces in such a way to minimize the remaining free cells. The additional requirement is that some *f* cells of the chessboard are already occupied (this is also given in input). See the example in figure (grey cells are occupied/forbidden).
